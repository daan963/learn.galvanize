										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European markets logged the worst monthly performance since September 2022 in October, despite making gains on the last day of the month, as investors assess a flurry of economic data and earnings.</p>
<p>The regional Stoxx 600<br />
ended 0.6% higher, with sectors mostly higher. The index has shed more than 4% in October, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>Oil and gas stocks were down 0.8% as BP’s London-listed shares closed 4.5% lower after it missed third quarter estimates. Brewers AB InBev and Carlsberg<br />
both reported lower sales yet higher revenue for the period due to pricing offsets.</p>
<p>Euro zone inflation fell to a two-year low of 2.9% in October, preliminary data showed Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expected 3.1%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, statistics agency Eurostat said the euro zone economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, below a forecast of stagnation.</p>
<p>The readings come after the European Central Bank last week paused its record run of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>In Asia-Pacific markets, Japanese stocks ended higher after the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy decision, while other regional markets fell as manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in China.</p>
<p>In the U.S. the S&amp;P 500 was little changed , with stocks set to close out a dismal month that saw Treasury yields surge to multiyear highs. The broader index dipped 0.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down by 0.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 53 points, or 0.18%.</p>

Vodafone to sell Spanish operations for $5.3 billion<br />
Telecoms group Vodafone<br />
announced Tuesday it has entered a binding agreement with Zegona Communications for the 5 billion euro ($5.3 billion) sale of its Spanish business.</p>
<p>The deal for 100% of Vodafone Spain comprises 4.1 billion euros in cash and up to 900 million euros in Redeemable Preference Shares, which allow the repayment of principal share capital to shareholders.</p>
<p>Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle said in a statement: “The sale of Vodafone Spain is a key step in right-sizing our portfolio for growth and will enable us to focus our resources in markets with sustainable structures and sufficient local scale.”</p>
<p>Vodafone Group shares were 1% lower at 2:15 p.m. London time. Trading of Zegona Communications shares was suspended on Sept. 22.</p>
