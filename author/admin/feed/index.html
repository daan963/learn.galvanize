										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European markets logged the worst monthly performance since September 2022 in October, despite making gains on the last day of the month, as investors assess a flurry of economic data and earnings.</p>
<p>The regional Stoxx 600<br />
ended 0.6% higher, with sectors mostly higher. The index has shed more than 4% in October, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>Oil and gas stocks were down 0.8% as BP‚Äôs London-listed shares closed 4.5% lower after it missed third quarter estimates. Brewers AB InBev and Carlsberg<br />
both reported lower sales yet higher revenue for the period due to pricing offsets.</p>
<p>Euro zone inflation fell to a two-year low of 2.9% in October, preliminary data showed Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expected 3.1%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, statistics agency Eurostat said the euro zone economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, below a forecast of stagnation.</p>
<p>The readings come after the European Central Bank last week paused its record run of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>In Asia-Pacific markets, Japanese stocks ended higher after the Bank of Japan‚Äôs monetary policy decision, while other regional markets fell as manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in China.</p>
<p>In the U.S. the S&amp;P 500 was little changed , with stocks set to close out a dismal month that saw Treasury yields surge to multiyear highs. The broader index dipped 0.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down by 0.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 53 points, or 0.18%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel Hamas War LIVE Updates: A spokesperson from the UN Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), James Elder, warned of the risk of infant deaths due to dehydration, with water output at 5% of normal levels, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>About 940 children are reported missing in Gaza, he said, with some thought to be stuck beneath the rubble.</p>
<p>&#8220;So child deaths due to dehydration, particularly infant deaths due to dehydration, are a growing threat,&#8221; he said, adding that children were getting sick from drinking salty water.</p>
<p>At least 50 bodies were recovered from the rubble after an Israeli airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp completely destroyed the shelter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gaza‚Äôs interior ministry reported the Jabalia refugee camp has been ‚Äúcompletely destroyed&#8221; by Israeli bombardment.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken will head back to Israel on Friday and also visit other countries in the region.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Hamas is part of an axis of evil Iran has formed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel&#8217;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan characterized Hamas as a group with intentions similar to that of the ‚ÄòNazis‚Äô and emphasized that the organization does not appear to seek a resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>Erdan said that Hamas is interested in the annihilation of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s armed forces have reported conducting operations that targeted over 600 militant sites in recent days, as they escalate their ground actions in the region.</p>
<p>This comes at a critical juncture in the conflict, with Palestinian civilians facing severe shortages of essential supplies such as fuel, food, and safe drinking water, as the conflict enters its fourth week.</p>
<p>More than 8,300 people have been killed ‚Äî 66% of them women and children ‚Äì and tens of thousands injured, according to the latest figures from Gaza‚Äôs Ministry of Health.</p>

Israel-Hamas War LIVE Updates: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls upon Muslim countries to boycott Israel<br />
Iran&#8217;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Muslim states to cease oil and food exports to Israel, demanding an end to its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, state media reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bombings on Gaza must stop immediately &#8230; the path of oil and food exports to the Zionist regime should be stopped,&#8221; Khamenei said in a speech, according to Iranian state media.</p>
<p>Israel has vowed to wipe out Tehran-backed Hamas, which rules Gaza, in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,400 people and saw hundreds taken hostage.</p>
<p>Israel has launched an unprecedented bombardment of Gaza and imposed a siege of the enclave. Palestinian authorities say more than 8,000 people have been killed.</p>
